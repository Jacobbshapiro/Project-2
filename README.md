## AAU Stories
AAU I would like to sign in with my google account,
AAU, I want to view a list of all merchandise (index view) that displays each Items price, description, date and time posted, and contact info,
AAU, I want to create merch for sale by entering the information on a page (new view) that has a form and submitting it,
AAU, when viewing the list of items, I want to click on a "detail" link displayed next to each item to view all of the properties for that item (show view),
AAU, I want to be able to log in to the app using my Google account so that I can post items for sale,
AAU, I want to be able to delete a item that I previously posted,
AAU, when viewing the details page (show view) for a item, I want to be able to add a bid for that item,
AAU, I want to be able to access each view via a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to:  ALL ITEMS, and ADD ITEM,
AAU, I want to be able to delete a item that I previously posted.

## Icebox
In the future I would like to add more security measures and the ability to add photos of the item youre posting. There is also a "Highest Bid" category on the (index view) that does not display the highest bid yet.
